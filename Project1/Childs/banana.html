	<p><b>Heart health:</b>Bananas are good for your heart. They are packed with potassium, 
		a mineral electrolyte that keeps electricity flowing throughout your body, which 
		is required to keep your heart beating. Bananas' high potassium and low sodium content
		 may also help protect your cardiovascular system against high blood pressure, according to the FDA.</p>

	<p><b>Depression and mood : </b>
		Bananas can be helpful in overcoming depression "due to high levels of 
		tryptophan, which the body converts to serotonin, the mood-elevating brain neurotransmitter," 
		Flores said. Plus, vitamin B6 can help you sleep well, and magnesium helps to relax muscles.</p>

	<p><b>Digestion and weight loss: </b>
	Bananas are high in fiber, which can help keep you regular.
	One banana can provide nearly 10 percent of your daily fiber requirement. Vitamin B6 can also help protect against type 
	2 diabetes and aid in weight loss, according to Flores. In general, bananas are a great weight loss food because they taste sweet 
	and are filling, which helps curb cravings. They also help sustain blood sugar levels during workouts.</p>
