	<p>The health benefits of carrots include reduced cholesterol, prevention from heart attacks, warding off of certain cancers, 
	improving vision, and reducing the signs of premature aging. Furthermore, carrots have the ability to increase the health of your skin,
	boost the immune system, improve digestion, increase cardiovascular health, detoxify the body, and boost oral health in a variety of ways. 
	They also provide a well-rounded influx of vitamins and minerals.</p>

	<p>Carrots are one of the most widely used and enjoyed vegetables in the world, partly because they grow relatively easily, and are very 
	versatile in a number of dishes and cultural cuisines. Carrots are scientifically classified as Daucus carota, and it is categorized as a root vegetable. 
	It is typically orange in color, but purple, white, yellow, and red carrots are out there, just not as common. The taproot of the carrot is the part of the 
	vegetable most commonly eaten, although the greens are still beneficial in salads and other forms.</p>
