	<p><b>Arthritis Management:</b> One of the most celebrated uses of pineapple in terms of health is its ability to reduce the inflammation of 
	joints and muscles, particularly those associated with arthritis, a truly debilitating disease that affects millions of people around the world. 
	Pineapples contain a relatively rare proteolytic enzyme called bromelain, which is primarily associated with breaking down complex proteins, 
	but it also has serious anti-inflammatory effects, and has been positively correlated with reducing the signs and symptoms of arthritis in many test subjects.</p>

	<p><b>Immune System: </b>A single serving of pineapple has more than 130% of the daily requirement of vitamin-C for human beings, making it one of the richest 
	and most delicious sources of ascorbic acid.  Vitamin C is mainly associated with reducing illness and boosting the immune system by stimulating the activity 
	of white blood cells and acting as an antioxidant to defend against the harmful effects of free radicals. Free radicals are dangerous byproducts of cellular 
	metabolism that can damage various organ systems and disrupt function, as well as cause healthy cells to mutate into cancerous ones. The vitamin C content of 
	pineapples defends against this.</p>

	<p><b>Tissue and Cellular Health: </b>One of the commonly overlooked benefits of vitamin C is its essential role in creating collagen. 
	This is partly the reason why it is seen as a healing vitamin, because collagen is the essential protein base of blood vessel
	walls, skin, organs, and bones. High vitamin C content helps you heal wounds and injuries to the body quickly, along with defending against infections and illness.</p>
	<p><b>Cancer Prevention: </b>In addition to the antioxidant potential of vitamin C in the battle against cancer, pineapples are also rich in various other antioxidants, 
	including vitamin A, beta carotene, bromelain, various flavonoid compounds, and high levels of manganese, which is an important co-factor of superoxide dismutase, 
	an extremely potent free radical scavenger that has been associated with a number of different cancers. Pineapple has directly been related to 
	preventing cancers of the mouth, throat, and breast.</p>
