	<p>The health benefits of avocado include weight management, protection from cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, treating 
	osteoarthritis and enhancing the absorption of nutrients for the body. It also reduces the risk of cancer, liver damage 
	and Vitamin K deficiency-related bleeding. Avocado helps in keeping eyes healthy and  protecting the skin from signs of 
	aging and the harmful effects of UV rays. It also helps in maintaining blood sugar levels and has antioxidant properties. 
	It even helps to increase circulation, boost cognitive abilities, and build stronger bones!</p>

	<p>According to a recent research study, avocado seeds are used for the treatment of diabetes, 
	inflammatory conditions, and hypertension, as well as for improving hypercholesterolemia. 
	Another research study shows that consumption of avocado leads to improved diet quality and nutrient intake, including a lowered risk of metabolic syndrome.</p>

	<p>Avocado has a high fatty acid content but contains extremely low levels of cholesterol. 
	Many people tend to stop eating avocado due to its high calorie content, 
	thinking that it may add to their weight. However, the amount of calories is very small when compared to butter, and 
	other high calorie dietary items. Also, much of the fat content comes from unique sources, like phytosterols, 
	which are beneficial for a number of reasons. This article discusses the various health benefits of avocado and 
	its nutritional content, but first, let's learn a bit more about this valuable and beneficial fruit.</p>
	<p>Avocados are also known as Alligator Pears, which is mainly due to its shape and the leathery appearance of its skin. 
	It is a fruit that is grown on Persea Americana, which is an evergreen tree from the Lauraceae family.
	Although it doesnâ€™t resemble these relatives, avocados are closely related to cinnamon and bay laurel. 
	It is usually tall and can grow up to a height of 65 feet. The approximate weight of avocados is between eight ounces and three pounds, 
	depending on the variety of avocado. It is harvested early and then allowed to ripen gradually when it is sold commercially.
	This is why avocados are called climacteric fruits, which only ripen after harvesting, just like bananas.</p>
