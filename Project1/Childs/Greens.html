	<p>Mother was right all along. Grandma also told you they were good for you. 
	So why do Americans eat green leafy vegetables only about once or twice a week? 
	Why are cabbage, broccoli, turnip greens, and spinach rarely seen at the 
	American dinner table? Why is lettuce the only green vegetable that most Americans ever use, 
	when green vegetables are recognized by nutritionists as one of the most inexpensive sources of so many important nutrients?</p>

	<p>Leafy vegetables are ideal for weight management as they are typically low in calories. They are useful inreducing the risk 
	of cancer and heart disease since they are low in fat, high in dietary fiber, and rich in folic acid, vitamin C, potassium and magnesium, 
	as well as containing a host of phytochemicals, such as lutein, beta-cryptoxanthin, zeaxanthin, and beta-carotene. One study showed that 
	an increment of one daily serving of green leafy vegetables, lowered the risk of cardiovascular disease by 11 percent. In the Adventist health study, 
	the frequent consumption of green salads by African-Americans was associated with a substantially lower risk of mortality.</p>

	<p>Because of their high magnesium content and low glycemic index, green leafy vegetables are 
	also valuable for persons with type 2 diabetes. An increase of 1 serving/day of green leafy 
	vegetables was associated with a 9 percent lower risk of diabetes. The high level of vitamin K 
	in greens makes them important for the production of osteocalcin, a protein essential for bone health. 
	The risk of hip fracture in middle-aged women was decreased 45% for one or more servings/day of green, leafy vegetables compared to fewer servings.</p>
